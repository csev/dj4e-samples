DJ4E Samples
============

This is a set of projects that provide free sample code to
support the www.dj4e.com web site.  These samples can be used
for Django 5.2 or Django 4.2.  Each is on a branch that you should
checkout.  Here are the instructions for the Django versions:

* Django 5.2 [README.md](https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/django52/README.md)

      git clone https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples.git
      git checkout django52

* Django 4.2 [README.md](https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/django42/README.md)

      git clone https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples.git
      git checkout django42

* Django 4.0 [README.md](https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/django40/README.md) (very obsolete)

      git clone https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples.git
      git checkout django40

The `main` branch is deprecated to allow for the support of multiple Django versions
simulataneously.  Django has a very agressive 
[deprecation process and timeline](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions)
so the www.dj4e.com course must support more than one Django version simulataneously.
